# HUD Design: [Game Name]

> **Status**: Draft | In Review | Approved | Implemented
> **Author**: [Name or agent — e.g., ui-designer]
> **Last Updated**: [Date]
> **Game**: [Game name — this is a single document per game, not per element]
> **Platform Targets**: [All platforms this HUD must work on — e.g., PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, Steam Deck]
> **Related GDDs**: [Every system that exposes information through the HUD — e.g., `design/gdd/combat.md`, `design/gdd/progression.md`, `design/gdd/quests.md`]
> **Accessibility Tier**: Basic | Standard | Comprehensive | Exemplary
> **Style Reference**: [Link to art bible HUD section if it exists — e.g., `design/gdd/art-bible.md § HUD Visual Language`]

> **Note — Scope boundary**: This document specifies all elements that overlay the
> game world during active gameplay — health bars, ammo counters, minimaps, quest
> trackers, subtitles, damage numbers, and notification toasts. For menu screens,
> pause menus, inventory, and dialogs that the player navigates explicitly, use
> `ux-spec.md` instead. The test: if it appears while the player is directly
> controlling their character, it belongs here.

## 1. HUD Philosophy

> **Why this section exists**: The HUD design philosophy is not decoration — it is a
> design constraint that every subsequent decision is measured against. Without a
> philosophy, individual elements get added on request ("the quest tracker wants a
> bigger icon") without any principled way to push back. With a philosophy, there is
> a shared, explicit standard. More importantly, the philosophy prevents the HUD from
> slowly growing to cover the game world while each individual addition seemed
> reasonable in isolation. Write this before specifying any elements.

**What is this game's relationship with on-screen information?**

[One paragraph. This is a design statement, not a description of features. Consider
the game's genre, pacing, and player fantasy. A stealth game's HUD philosophy might
be: "The world is the interface. If the player has to look away from the environment
to survive, the HUD has failed." A tactics game might say: "Complete situational
awareness is the game. The HUD is not an overlay — it is the battlefield."

Reference comparable games if helpful, but describe your specific stance:
Example — diegetic-first action RPG: "We treat screen information as a concession,
not a feature. Every HUD element must earn its pixel space by answering the question:
would the player make demonstrably worse decisions without this information visible?
If the answer is 'they'd adapt,' we put it in the environment instead."]

**Visibility principle** — when in doubt, show or hide?

[State the default resolution for ambiguous cases. Options:
- Default to HIDE: information is available on demand (e.g., Dark Souls — no quest tracker, no minimap, stats are in a menu)
- Default to SHOW: players prefer to be informed; cluttered is better than uncertain
- Default to CONTEXTUAL: information appears when it becomes relevant and fades when it does not
Most games benefit from contextual defaults. State your game's default clearly so every element decision is consistent.]

**The Rule of Necessity for this game**:

[Complete this sentence: "A HUD element earns its place when ______________."

Example: "...the player would have to stop playing to find the same information
elsewhere, or would make meaningfully worse decisions without it."

Example: "...removing it in playtesting causes measurable frustration or confusion
in more than 25% of testers within the first hour of play."

This rule is the veto power over feature requests to add HUD elements. Document it
so it can be cited in design reviews.]

## 2. Information Architecture

> **Why this section exists**: Before specifying any HUD element's visual design,
> position, or behavior, you must answer a more fundamental question: should this
> information be on the HUD at all? This section is a forcing function — it requires
> you to categorize EVERY piece of information the game world generates and make an
> explicit, intentional decision about how each is presented. "We'll figure that out
> later" is how games end up with 18 elements competing for the player's peripheral
> vision. This table is the master inventory of game information, not just HUD information.

| Information Type | Always Show | Contextual (show when relevant) | On Demand (menu/button) | Hidden (environmental / diegetic) | Reasoning |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| [Health / Vitality] | [X if action game — player needs constant awareness] | [X if exploration game — show only when injured] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: always visible because health decisions (retreat, heal) must be instant in combat] |
| [Primary resource (mana / stamina / ammo)] | [ ] | [X — show when resource is being consumed or is critically low] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because stable resource levels are not decision-relevant] |
| [Secondary resource (currency / materials)] | [ ] | [ ] | [X — check in inventory] | [ ] | [Example: on-demand because resource totals don't affect immediate gameplay decisions] |
| [Minimap / Compass] | [X] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: always visible because navigation decisions are constant during exploration] |
| [Quest objective] | [ ] | [X — show when objective changes or player is near it] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual — player knows their objective; only remind at key moments] |
| [Enemy health bar] | [ ] | [X — show only during combat encounters] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because enemy health is irrelevant outside combat] |
| [Status effects (buffs/debuffs)] | [ ] | [X — show when active] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because status effects only affect decisions when present] |
| [Dialogue subtitles] | [X when dialogue is playing] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: always show while dialogue is active — accessibility requirement] |
| [Combo / streak counter] | [ ] | [X — show while combo is active, hide on reset] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because it communicates active performance, not baseline state] |
| [Timer] | [ ] | [X — show only in timed sequences] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because timers only exist in specific encounter types] |
| [Tutorial prompts] | [ ] | [X — show for first-time situations only] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual and one-time; never repeat to experienced players] |
| [Score / points] | [ ] | [X — show in score-relevant modes only] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual by game mode; hidden in modes where score is irrelevant] |
| [XP / level progress] | [ ] | [ ] | [X — available via character screen] | [ ] | [Example: on-demand because progression does not affect in-moment gameplay decisions] |
| [Waypoint / objective marker] | [ ] | [X — show when player is navigating to objective] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual — suppress during cutscenes, cinematic moments, and free exploration] |

## 3. Layout Zones

> **Why this section exists**: The game world is the primary content — the HUD is a
> frame around it. Before placing any element, divide the screen into named zones
> with explicit positions and safe zone margins. This section prevents two failure
> modes: (1) elements placed ad-hoc until the screen is cluttered, and (2) elements
> that overlap platform-required safe zones and get rejected in certification.
> Every element in Section 4 must be assigned to a zone defined here.

> Rule for zone placement: the center 40% of the screen (both horizontally and
> vertically) is the player's primary focus area. Keep this zone as clear as
> possible at all times. HUD elements that appear in the center zone — crosshairs,
> interaction prompts, hit markers — must be minimal, high-contrast, and brief.

### 3.2 Zone Specification Table

| Zone Name | Screen Position | Safe Zone Compliant | Primary Elements | Max Simultaneous Elements | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------|
| [Top Left] | [Top-left corner, within safe margin] | [Yes — 10% from top, 10% from left] | [Health bar, stamina bar, shield bar] | [3] | [Vital status — player's own resources. Priority zone for player state.] |
| [Top Center] | [Top edge, centered horizontally] | [Yes — 10% from top] | [Quest objective, area name (on enter)] | [1 — only one message at a time] | [Use for narrative context, not mechanical information. Keep text minimal.] |
| [Top Right] | [Top-right corner, within safe margin] | [Yes — 10% from top, 10% from right] | [Ammo count, ability cooldowns] | [2] | [Weapon/ability state. Most relevant during active combat.] |
| [Center] | [Screen center ±15%] | [N/A — not a margin zone] | [Crosshair, interaction prompt, hit marker] | [1 active at a time] | [CRITICAL: Nothing persistent here. Only momentary indicators.] |
| [Bottom Left] | [Bottom-left corner, within safe margin] | [Yes — 10% from bottom, 10% from left] | [Minimap, ability icons] | [2] | [Navigation and ability readout. Small, non-intrusive.] |
| [Bottom Center] | [Bottom edge, centered horizontally] | [Yes — 10% from bottom] | [Subtitles, tutorial prompts] | [2 — subtitle + tutorial may coexist] | [Highest-priority accessibility zone. Never place other elements here.] |
| [Bottom Right] | [Bottom-right corner, within safe margin] | [Yes — 10% from bottom, 10% from right] | [Notification toasts, pick-up feedback] | [3 stacked] | [Transient notifications. Stack vertically. Oldest disappears first.] |

**Safe zone margins by platform**:

| Platform | Top | Bottom | Left | Right | Notes |
|----------|-----|--------|------|-------|-------|
| [PC — windowed] | [0% — no safe zone required] | [0%] | [0%] | [0%] | [But respect minimum resolution — elements must not crowd at 1280x720] |
| [PC — fullscreen] | [3%] | [3%] | [3%] | [3%] | [Slight margin for 4K TV-connected PCs] |
| [Console — TV] | [10%] | [10%] | [10%] | [10%] | [Action-safe zone for broadcast-spec TVs. Some TVs overscan beyond this.] |
| [Steam Deck] | [5%] | [5%] | [5%] | [5%] | [Small screen; safe zone is smaller but crowding risk is higher] |
| [Mobile — portrait] | [15% top] | [10% bottom] | [5%] | [5%] | [15% top avoids notch/camera cutout on most devices] |
| [Mobile — landscape] | [5%] | [5%] | [15% left] | [15% right] | [Thumb placement on landscape — side zones are obscured by hands] |

## 4. HUD Element Specifications

> **Why this section exists**: Each HUD element needs its own specification to be
> built correctly. Ad-hoc implementation of HUD elements produces inconsistent
> sizing, mismatched update frequencies, missing urgency states, and accessibility
> failures. This section is the implementation brief for every element — fill it
> completely before any element moves into development.

### 4.1 Element Overview Table

> One row per HUD element. This is the master inventory for implementation planning.

| [Damage Numbers] | [World-space / anchored to entity] | [No — context] | [Show on any damage event; duration 800ms] | [CombatSystem] | [On event] | [5% per number] | [18px minimum] | [3] | [Option to disable; numbers can overwhelm for photosensitive players] |
| [Status Effect Icons] | [Top Left — below health bar] | [No — context] | [Show when any status effect is active on player] | [StatusSystem] | [On effect add/remove] | [3% per icon] | [24px per icon] | [3] | [Icon + text label on hover/focus. Never icon-only.] |
